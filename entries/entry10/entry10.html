            <h1>Thank You for Visiting!</h1>
            <p>
                This project was created as a playful way to explore and learn 
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the context of designing outfits.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a fun journey filled with creativity and experimentation. 
                I hope you enjoyed exploring it as much as we enjoyed making it!
            </p>
            <p class="goodbye">Goodbye, and see you next time!</p>
